June 15th marked Pawprint Prototyping's return to [OpenSauce](https://opensauce.live) - the whimsical convention
for Science and Makers YouTubers, and brainchild of [William Osman](https://www.youtube.com/@williamosman).

A menagerie of members proudly presented these fine projects at our exhibitor table:

* [The Badge!](#badge)
* [Return of the ARM](#return-of-the-arm)
* [Pirate Box Badge](#pirate-box-badge)
* [Long Range Thermal Imaging](#long-range-thermal-imaging)
* [Water Plants Game](#water-plants-game)

## Badge

We were all especially excited to return this year since one of our members, [DC Punks](https://dcpunks.computer/)
had the honor of designing the OpenSauce badge, which features LED blinking eyes courtesy of a few extra jellybean
components to form an [astable multivibrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator).

Thanks to the tireless efforts of our roadshow team, a couple of randomly canceled Digikey orders, and a few trips up
and down the SF Bay Peninsula, the Pawprint OpenSauce booth furnished component kits featuring everything needed to give
this robot PCB badge blinkie eyes for just $10, and the satisfaction of supporting your local hackerspace.  To everyone
that purchased a kit from us, **thank you so much!**  In total we sold 500 kits and raised a little
over $3000 for our non-profit to keep the lights on, servers running, and laser lasing.

## Return of The ARM

In the months leading up the event, our build team was hoping to bring something new and on-theme to OpenSauce this
year.  Unfortunately, the perils of integration hell and an unfortunate time crunch led us to shelve our new project
and dust the cobwebs off last year's project, The _Amazing Raygun Machine_ (ARM for short).  Built originally by a core
team of 5 members over the course of 3 months, this project exemplifies our spirit of collaboration and Pawprint's
mission to foster a network of hackers in the local community.

## Pirate Box Badge

This [#BadgeLife](https://defcon.social/tags/badgelife) entry for DEF CON, the world's largest hacking conference, was
designed by Geo and hosts a wide variety of computer networking abilities.  It's also a cute fox with zero depth-perception.


## Long Range Thermal Imaging

This thermal camera, built to be mounted to the outside of a building for surveillance purposes, was reverse engineered
by Geo to be controlled by a playstation game controller.  Are you hot or not?  Finally, science has the answer.

## Water Plants Game

In this game by Pawprint member Dingo, help our friend get the chores of watering the plants around the water plant so
they can get back to their favorite activity: napping.
