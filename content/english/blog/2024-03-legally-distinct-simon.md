With [Further Confusion](https://furtherconfusion.org/) coming up soon, we wanted to build something fun and interactive that had the secondary benefit of
promoting our hackerspace to any and all of the con's thousands of attendees.

As with many of our core collaborative projects (sample size: 2 so far), we started by spitballing ideas after a member
meeting on the whiteboard, and landed on a giant game of "Simon-Says", blown up good, bapable, fursuit-paw-size proportions.
