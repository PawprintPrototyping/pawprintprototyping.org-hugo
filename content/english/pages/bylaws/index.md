## Appendix B - Code of Conduct
The Pawprint Prototyping Code of Conduct is forked from the !!Con Code of Conduct. It reads as follows:

### The Short Version
Pawprint Prototyping is dedicated to providing a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of hackerspace users in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery may not be appropriate at times.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members or guests. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the Pawprint Prototyping.

Members or Guests violating these rules may be asked to leave at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.

### The Longer Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, derisive comments regarding technical background, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members or Guests asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Pawprint Prototyping.

If a member or guest engages in behavior that violates the anti-harassment policy, the board of directors may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the space.
