## Join the Movement

You're here because you're part of a community that refuses to accept the status quo. You're a maker, a creator, a 
hacker – someone who sees the world as a canvas waiting to be reimagined, and who's not afraid to let their fur shine. 
At Pawprint Prototyping, we're building a counterculture that empowers individuals to challenge the dominant narratives 
to imagine a better future.

## Our Mission

We're not just a hackerspace – we're a laboratory for creativity and innovation. Our members are the spark that ignites

all. Your contribution will help us:

* Upgrade our equipment and facilities to support the latest technologies and techniques
* Host workshops, events, and exhibitions that showcase the work of our members and the broader maker community
* Develop programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the maker movement
* Provide scholarships, computers, accessories, and financial assistance to individuals who might not otherwise have access to our resources
