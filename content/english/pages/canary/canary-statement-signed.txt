# Signed Canary Statement

Totally Legit Agency, dba Pawprint Prototyping, positively confirms that the integrity of our system is sound:  all our
infrastructure is in our control, we have not knowingly been compromised or suffered a data breach, we have not
disclosed any private encryption keys, and we have not been forced to modify our system to allow access or information
leakage to a third party.

This canary will be re-signed on the following dates:

 * May 1
 * November 1

We will include a link to a recent news article[1] in each update to establish that the signature was not pre-generated.

## Frequently asked questions

Q: Are you compromised by law enforcement?

A: No. We have never permitted installation of any hardware or software monitoring on any system that we control;
law enforcement has not taken our servers; does not, and has never had access to them.

Q: Couldn't the government just make you say that?

A: Forced speech is actually quite rare in the US legal context. It's usually only in cases of consumer protection
where the government has been successful in compelling speech (e.g. forced cigarette warnings). Nevertheless, no they
aren't forcing us to say anything.

Q: Why does the new Canary not mention gag orders, FISA court orders, National Security Letters, etc?

A: A Canary is supposed to signal important risk information to users, but there is also danger in signaling the wrong
thing to users or leading to general fear and confusion for no good reason. This Canary is limited to significant
events that could compromise the security of users.
